Let us Explore. Please join me as I quest to learn more about the underlying patterns and trends in US zoos, aquariums, and related facilities. One of the underlying questions I aim to answer is “What makes a zoo good?” We see news articles for the “Top 10 Zoos in the Country” all of the time. These are typically computed by votes from the public and heavily promoted by the zoos themselves. Instead of looking at popularity I will explore different aspects of what can contribute to making a facility successful.
